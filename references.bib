@inproceedings{tier_study,
	abstract = {This chapter investigates competitive Pok{\'e}mon usage tier classification given a Pok{\'e}mon's stats and typing. Pok{\'e}mon were classified into the usage tiers defined by the competitive battling website Pok{\'e}mon Showdown based on their individual base stats, the sum of all their base stats (BST), and their number of type weaknesses and type resists. Classifications were done using Weka's J48 decision tree, lazy IBk 1-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression algorithm. The algorithms were evaluated by the metrics of accuracy and precision. The results of this study give insight into what factors most impact a Pok{\'e}mon's use on competitive teams, and could give future insights on how Pok{\'e}mon may perform as other Pok{\'e}mon fall in and out of popularity, and as more Pok{\'e}mon are added in future games.},

@article{esports,
	abstract = { Accompanying esports' explosion in popularity, the amount of academic research focused on organized, competitive gaming has grown rapidly. From 2002 through March 2018, esports research has developed from nonexistent into a field of study spread across seven academic disciplines. We review work in business, sports science, cognitive science, informatics, law, media studies, and sociology to understand the current state of academic research of esports and to identify convergent research questions, findings, and trends across fields. },
